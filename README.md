# FreeBSD Post Install

This is my personal FreeBSD post-installation script that automates the process of downloading and installing the necessary packages and performing various tasks. 
# Usage
Dont clone the repo because the script will do that itself. Instead use fetch to download the script and run it as root. 
```
fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wolandark/FreeBSD_Post_Install/main/FreeBSD_Post_Install.sh
```

This is a very basic shell script that aims to aid users who want to experince FreeBSD in a graphical enviorment. This script assumes the following but will work just fine in any case:

- You are on a clean install of FreeBSD 14+
- You are familiar with how unix operating systems work and are able to alter the script should you need to
- You know what you're doing
- You prefer to startx instead of using a display manager although any display manager can be installed and enabled by the user if needed
- You are connected to the internet 
- You have atleast 5gb of storage 

Please feel free to use, distribute and change the script to your needs. Also please feel free to make suggestions and pull requests and fork the repo.

I do not claim the credit for the icewm theme. The nord icewm theme is available for download from [here](https://www.box-look.org/p/1952840) and the credit goes to the amazing person who made the theme. I have of course added my own keybinindg and certain customizations to the icewm files.
